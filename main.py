	Function to display a countdown from m to zero with each number 
	on a new line with a gap of 0.6 seconds between each number.
	Parameters:
		>m - value to be counted down from.
	Return  values:

	each undesired input.
	Parameters:
		>prompt - the prompt that you want to be displayed just like
		the prompt you give as parameter to the function input().

	Return values:
		>user's answer in lower case.
